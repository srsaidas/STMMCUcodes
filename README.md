# STMMCUcodes
<!-- Main title of the repository -->

A collection of C code snippets and example programs for STM microcontrollers.  
<!-- Short description of what this repo is about -->

## Contents
<!-- Explains what kind of files are inside -->
- [ITM Enabling and Usage](/ITM_sendChar.c)  

## Purpose
<!-- Why this repo exists -->
This repository is intended as a quick reference and reusable set of building blocks for embedded development on STM MCUs.  
Each file is minimal and focused, making it easy to integrate into larger projects.  

## How to Use
<!-- Instructions for developers -->
1. Browse the `C` files inside the folder.  
2. Copy and paste the relevant snippet into your STM32 project.  
3. Adjust pin mappings, clock settings, and configuration as needed.  

## Notes
<!-- Extra guidance -->
- Code is tested on STM32 family MCUs but may require modifications for different series.  
- Organized for learning and quick prototyping, not full production projects.  

## License
<!-- Optional: you can add one if you want -->
MIT License (or your preferred license).
